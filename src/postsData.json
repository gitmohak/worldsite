It bridges two different worlds. Old Delhi, once the capital of Islamic India, is a labyrinth of narrow lanes lined with crumbling havelis and formidable mosques. In contrast, the imperial city of New Delhi created by the British Raj is composed of spacious, tree-lined avenues and imposing government buildings.</p><p>Delhi has been the seat of power for several rulers and many empires for about a millennium. Many a city was built, destroyed and then rebuilt here. Interestingly, many of Delhi&rsquo;s rulers played a dual role, first as destroyers and then as creators.

        "text": "<p>The flight path into Logan Airport in Boston gives a birds eye view of the Civil War era stone fort and star-shaped prison, Fort Warren on Georges Island (one of the Boston Islands), guarding one of the most famous harbors in the world &mdash; Boston Harbor &mdash; once plied by Clipper Ships, frigates, and revolutionary privateers. The oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, - the U.S.S. Constitution &mdash; sails out to the fort once a year - on the 4th of July.</p><p>Boston is really where the patriots fomented their philosophies and oratories to fire up and forge a new nation on a new continent. But the natives to the region once lived on the Boston Islands long before battle cries were in the air.</p><p>I was on my own tea party &mdash; at one of Boston's most prestigious hotels in the newly renovated Old Boston Harbor area. The Seaport Hotel is ranked as one of the best places to stay according to readers who placed it on the Gold List in the 2003 Cond&eacute; Naste Traveler Magazine poll.</p><p>The best way to get from Logan Airport to the Seaport Hotel is by sea - on the city water taxi ($10),&nbsp;but you have to jump on the Checkerboard Fleet tender because it is the only one that goes to the old wharf area. The Checkerboard Fleet has the most Boston Bay stops from the Harborside Hyatt where you embark, with direct service to the entire Boston waterfront:</p><p>The Checkerboard Fleet services Anthony's Pier 4, Fan Pier, U.S. Courthouse, Barking Crab Restaurant, Museum Wharf/Congress Street, Long Wharf at Christopher Columbus Park (the main wharf for downtown Boston), Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market, Louis Wharf, Burroughs Wharf, North Station/Fleet Center, Constitution Marina and the U.S.S. Constitution (berthed in Charlestown), Shipyard Quarters Marina, and the Boston Boat Yard and Marina. Call the fleet at 617/422-0392 or catch the Harborside Hyatt airport ground shuttle to the docks, ring the big brass bell, and the taxi pulls up right to the watery curb. The boats even service the FleetBoston Pavilion steps from the Seaport Hotel where I caught the performance of Jack Johnson the first night I was in town. Conventioneers attending conferences at the World Trade Center across the street from the Seaport Hotel are offered easy access to a superb hotel setting. For return visits to the airport, the doorman, concierge, or hotel front desk can order a a tender to pick you uo.</p><p>Beantown native and taxi driver (sailor?), Bill, pointed out the Seaport Hotel from the water's edge. The Boston Harbor and wharf area has been undergoing a tremendous refit, renovation, and refurbishing, and although the Seaport Hotel is quite new (opened May 1, 1998), the Federalist Revival architectural style makes the 17-story tower a seamless blend with the older warehouse brickwork. I enjoy places that do not become garish from their surroundings, and it is evident that much thought went into the hotel's planning.</p><p>I reasoned that the Seaport Hotel's proximity to the World Trade Center across the street was why it has been bestowed all those &#34;best of&#34; award, including: &#34;The Pinnacle Award&#34; from Successful Meetings Magazine; &#34;The Inner Circle Award&#34; from Associations Meetings Magazine; &#34;The Excellence of the East Award&#34; from Meetings East Magazine; &#34;The Planner's Choice Award; and &#34;The Gold Key Award&#34; from Meetings and Conventions Magazine.</p><p>The World Trade Center juts over the water offering 250,000 feet of exhibition space, with the 425-guest room Seaport Hotel offering an additional 17,000 total square feet of convention space and a luxurious 8,200 square foot ballroom. You can even register at the hotel at the World Trade Center. How is that for convenient? The hotel offers expert meeting planning staff with ResourcePlus services. The hotel is also close to Boston's financial district (guests receive complimentary shuttle service),</p><p>Most of these awards were granted for the Seaport's high level of service, quality of food and beverage, flexible function space, and good value on room rates. But I found that the hotel is also a great family destination getaway.</p><p>Upon check in the front desk issues kids swim goggles, a sea themed gift, and Ben and Jerry's Phish Food ice cream &mdash; delivered to your room, with the &#34;Vacation By The Sea Package&#34;. The kids will love the pool in the Health Center - it has piped in underwater music!</p><p>The hotel has developed various vacation packages, including a late June to after Labor Day &#34;Vacation By The Sea&#34; offer that comes with a four pack of tickets to the New England Aquarium, with complimentary water taxi for those that don't want to make the easy walk to Long Wharf. The IMAX Theater is another great complex at the same wharf, or pick up the hourly Boston Trolley tour, or walk The Freedom Trail further on to Fanueil Hall where the patriots voiced treason with a split from the Brits.</p><p>Other packages grant free admission for the family to the the Children's Museum. All packages allow the use of the Seaport's Health Club.</p><p>My favorite Seaport Hotel package is the &#34;Wedding of Jacqueline Beuvier to John F. Kennedy Package&#34; that is presented in conjunction with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston; 2003 celebrates the 50th anniversary of their wedding (they were actually married only 10 years), so the package probably won't be repeated. You should visit the library/museum for the exhibit, where you will see Jackie's wedding dress, her emerald and diamond engagement ring, and color footage of the reception.</p><p>The Seaport also offers &#34;Weekend Fitness Escapes&#34;, &#34;Romance Packages&#34;, a &#34;Commuter's Rest Package&#34; and a &#34;Grandparents Getaway Package&#34;, but I am certain the sales staff is creating even other packages for your pleasure.</p><p>I am always interested in anything nautical, so the appeal of the &#34;Spirit of Boston Cruise Package&#34; piqued my interest. You dine and dance the night on the luxurious private yacht Spirit of Boston, cruising the inner Boston Harbor. Maybe you will get a chance to toss tea overboard. Then you stay overnight at the Seaport Hotel with full buffet breakfast in the morning.</p><p>I was checking my email in the &#34;off the lobby&#34; kiosk's solo computer when I learned of the Seaport Hotel's separate 24-hour business center with high speed internet access. Then I found out each room is complete with a dataport, and the hotel has gone wireless.</p><p>Well, hi WiFi. No need for the 24-hour Concierge, except I still like the personal touch when arranging sailing trips because the concierge knows the skippers personally.</p><p>The Seaport offers a few transportation options for guests interested in visiting other areas of Boston. The South Station shuttle, which runs Monday &mdash; Friday, providing convenient access to the MBTA's red line subway and from there, they can connect to the green and orange lines. Additionally, the Seaport Hotel operates a shuttle on Saturdays going to South Station and Faneuil Hall. The Concierge can make arrangements for other private ground transportation, including service by BostonCoach. The water shuttle, operated in partnership with the MBTA, leaves from the World Trade Center and stops at the U.S. Courthouse (providing access to the Children's Museum and Tea Party Ship), and Lovejoy Wharf (access to the North End and other historical monuments).</p><p>I felt it was time to check out the old historic waterfront that has seen centuries of use. Everyone at the hotel is knowledgeable of their neighborhood. The bellman directed me to the East Wharf area to find out his favorite local &#34;No Name Restaurant&#34;. After a dark walk down a cobblestoned quay stretching the length of long rows of brick warehouses, I found the second story fishery packed with locals crowding in before the FleetBoston arena concert beating in the nightscape background. I found a stool quickly at the bar and ordered the famous clam chowder from &#34;Pop&#34; who has been serving drinks here since the revolt.</p><p>After the FleetBoston concert I relaxed in the Seaport's lobby lounge bar near the 4-Diamond, 110-seat, non-smoking, Aura Restaurant. The Aura is a signature cuisine winner in Boston, allowing kids under 12 free dining with adults with the &#34;Vacation By The Sea Package&#34;.</p><p>Aura Executive Chef John Merrill grew up on Long Island, New York, and has been a fish cutter since his teens. After degrees at the Culinary Institute of America in Hartford, Connecticut, he served as Rounds Cook, Sous Chef and Banquet Chef for many prestigious resorts on the East Coast, including the Reach Resort in Key West, Florida, and the Boston Harbor Hotel, where he was the Garde Manage Chef. Since the Seaport's 1998 opening Chef Merrill has been creating many award winning culinary presentations with elegant dining overlooking the harbor lights.</p><p>He selects specialty New England farmers and purveyors for fresh homegrown ingredients that are blended splendidly into wonderful textures and flavors. You may have caught him on &#34;Ready, Set, Cook&#34; on the Food Network, or at the Boston Wine Expo, which the Seaport Hotel sponsors. For Aura restaurant reservations call</p>"

However the founding of Seattle is dated to 1851, with the arrival of Denny Party. Though it was John C Holgate which established the farming settlement in Seattle but in 1852 Arthur A. Denny left the original site for Elliot Bay.<br /><br />In the beginning, forest of at least 1, 000 to 2,000 year old tress as long as 400 covered most of what is today Seattle. Thus, Seattle mostly depended on its Timber industry. The development of Seattle also leads to a battle known as the Battle of Seattle in 25 January 1856 between the local Native American and people of Seattle.<br /><br />It was on 14 January 1865, when Seattle was officially named as a town and chartered in the next year 1869. As the time passed, Seattle gradually started to take shape of a city though its school barely worked; sewage and plumbing system were a rarity. Nevertheless its first church was opened in 1869 and a railroad known as the Great Northern Railway in 1884, followed by Seattle printers in 1886 and cigar makers in 1887, tailors in 1889 and both brewers and musicians in 1890.<br /><br />Seattle was well, settled on the road to establishment and prosperity but the great fire on June 6 1889, and brought this magnificent development to an obvious halt. Though the fire soon turned into a Gold Rush Era for the Seattle settlers and this automatically improved the economy of Seattle and lead to immigration and an obvious construction expanding Seattle. The second big boom hit Seattle in world War two. And thus from then there was no stopping though shut of Boeing factories lost job of 70, 000 people but never the less it didn&rsquo;t halted the prosperity.<br /><br />Roads, Gymnasiums, schools, universities and other facilities were common in Seattle and with Microsoft moving its small firm in Seattle in 1979 and by 1985 Microsoft was a billionaire firm, benefiting Seattle with jobs, opportunities.<br /><br />Today&rsquo;s Seattle, is a highly developed, physically beautiful, rich with history and cultures. It is far more independent though its structure is same to what it was in 1960s. Now it hosts people from different race, cultures and belief. It is very much an example of a highly established city.</p>"

That is why it Chicago is considered to be one of the best places in the United States to break away from the routine,&nbsp;unwind and have the quality time they have been yearning for.</p><p>Chicago is home to numerous diverse communities, which are great fun to explore with someone special. Each one has a unique and rich culture they can call their own. The first thing you should do to get to know all of Chicago is to join the Chicago Neighborhood Tours. It is a guided walking tour, and is a very enjoyable to do as a pair when the weather is favorable.</p><p>Another great way to get to know Chicagoland is to have a taste of their food. If you are going to Chicago in the summer, one of the things you can do is check out the Taste of Chicago event in Grant Park. It is an annual gathering of more than sixty local restaurateurs serving both residents and visitors sumptuous Chicago specialties, ethnic and exotic cuisines, and the regular family-friendly dishes.

For those with inclination to science, art, history, culture and the like, there are a lot of museums in Chicago that you can check out. If you follow the works of the great Frank Lloyd Wright, one of the most recommended things to do would be to join the Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture bus tour in Oak Park just fifteen minutes from Chicago.</p><p>Men love sports, women love shopping. Good thing Chicago has both to allow couples to compromise. There are lots of sporting events in Chicago as well as some serious shopping to be had. Next, cool off at the Chicago Park District for some down time with your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend. Choose a spot from one of the over 500 parks in the district and enjoy an a quiet picnic in the late afternoon. Or you both can get all-dolled up for a nice romantic dinner at either the Signature Room at the 95th located at the John Hancock Observatory or Seasons at the Four Seasons Hotel Chicago.</p><p>The best way to conclude your Chicago trip is to head off to the Funky Buddha Lounge for some drinks and the latest hot music. You might even get the chance to see your favorite Hollywood celebrities partying the night away in the dance floor. As your Chicago trip comes to an end, you realize that, with all the things to do in Chicago, the city provides the kind of escape you and your loved one really need.</p>"

        "text": "<p>Living in London is a dream comes true for many. For these people,&nbsp;it is a city where everything is possible. For many it is the beginning of a dream. London has seldom disappointed one who has lived there. It has a rich treasure of history, culture, education, natural beauty, modern amenities and employment opportunities. It imparts a sense of pride into its citizens. The reasons are many, and significant ones too.</p><p>London is the cradle of the largest urban economy of Europe. It rubs shoulders with Tokyo and New York in being a significant powerhouse of the world. The multicultural population of London is one of its greatest advantages, and thus attracts all leading global businesses. The predominant use of English law and language also gives it an edge over competing economic powers.</p><p>Employment in London</p><p>The British economy is presently in a vibrant state as it boasts of an annual growth rate of 2%. That London contributes significantly to this success story goes without saying. The employed population of the city is almost 3.5 million. Moreover, the wages this workforce enjoys are almost 20% more than what is enjoyed by the rest of the country. Thus, more and more people are attracted to London and they seldom have complaints about their pay packets. Manual labour has an average salary of &pound;20,000, while urban white-collar jobs offer attractive six-figure salaries. The greatest drawbacks of the people staying and earning in London are the exorbitant costs of living and housing. Rental costs and housing expenses in London are almost double of what they are anywhere else in the country. But the problem is tackled by many by putting up at the fringes of the capital and traveling everyday.</p><p>Major industries in London</p><p>Finance happens to be the lifeline of London&rsquo;s industries. It is the largest of all the industries London has. The city boasts of being the base of more than fifty of the top hundred companies of UK, and more than hundred of the top five hundred companies of Europe. The newly developed Canary Wharf houses the global headquarters of esteemed companies like Barclays, HSBC and Reuters and hence functions as the secondary financial center.</p><p>Apart from finance, an industry which is growing big and fast in London, is the creative sector. Compared to other countries, the growth of the creative industry has been significant. It employs more than 4,000,000 workers and has an annual turnover of more than &pound;14 billion.</p><p><strong>Educational opportunities in London</strong></p><p>London provides excellent educational opportunities to deserving candidates. Esteemed universities like the University of London, London Metropolitan University, University of Westminster, Royal College of Art and prestigious colleges like King&rsquo;s College London, Imperial College London and London School of Economics and Political Science attract students from all over the world. London residents can get the best of education, as a degree from any of these institutions is considered priceless.</p><p>Leisure spots in London</p><p>London has many beautiful places that can delight a tourist. There are lots of Hotels and&nbsp;places to stay in London&nbsp;too. But the best thing about London is that people living there for decades also never stop being tourists there because of the attractive and interesting spots that never seem to get old. The Tower of London, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, the museums, the palaces, the churches and the parks never cease to attract the veteran visitors.</p>"

        "text": "<p>If your company offices are within a city close to Liverpool or perhaps on the outskirts of Liverpool then you may be thinking about moving to the centre of Liverpool.&nbsp;In such circumstances,&nbsp;you may be asking yourself how moving to Liverpool could benefit your business as you don't want to relocate without knowing all of the facts.So here's a short guide containing some of the things that Liverpool can offer, based on facts provided:If your office doesn't have many contemporary features it may not meet your needs as it should.</p><p>For example, it may not have a good number of power sockets and wiring, which means that you may not be able to operate as well as a contemporary company does. Plus a dilapidated and dirty office may not be the best idea if you want to impress clients - an old style office may make them think your methods are old too. You may be intent on improving your company persona, in which case there is a diverse mix of modern offices in Liverpool that can meet your requirements with ease.Offices in Liverpool tend to have quite a bit of floor space, which could be ideal for a growing company. In fact, there are a lot of offices within the Liverpool area, which could be very much what a growing business needs. If your business has expanded rapidly in the last 6 months then a Liverpool office could be ideal for your needs.</p><p>Moreover your business may be divided into a mix of departments including human resources and accounts, which means a good level of floor space would be an essential need.Having premises in a well known area is necessary for a selection of businesses and one particular reason is that it is very beneficial to be situated near to similar businesses and suppliers. This is because without a network of surrounding businesses a company can feel out of the loop and unequipped to handle client needs. If your firm needs specialist industry equipment or just simple office supplies, then being in the right location could be very convenient.</p><p>That is why a lot of companies have ended up taking offices in the bustling centre of Liverpool as opposed to an isolated spot in the suburbs, it works out far better.As the Liverpool region has been the subject of much new development, it is now in possession of a wide spread of new offices available, which could just take your company to the next stage on the business ladder. This is because when looking for an office, you want to take a look at up to three different properties so that you have some choice in your office space. As a result, because Liverpool is a top area for office space and you are looking for a Liverpool office, then a company will have a number of great offices on its books for you to see.Many people who live in Liverpool will let you know that the area has convenient public transport and a train network that is ideal for commuting workers.</p><p>Although this network is perhaps not the best in the world, it is extremely convenient if you work in Liverpool or are planning to take an office in the Liverpool area and are concerned about your workers getting to work on time. Moreover, Liverpool public transport can be used by clients making their way towards your offices. Just keep in mind that you don't end up trying to settle on an office that is inaccessible to workers and customers.If the office you are tenanting at the moment is tiny then you might be happy to know that the available Liverpool offices come in numerous sizes and can meet a diversity of needs. So if you have outgrown your current office perhaps because you have recently taken on new staff, bought new equipment or even because you are taking on more clients - then a Liverpool office may be exactly what you need.</p><p>You will then be in a better position to meet the needs of your clients, which will boost the growth of your firm.Liverpool is a wonderful place to entertain clientele or hold business events as it has lots of nice restaurants, which are all located in and around the Liverpool area. As a result, a Liverpool office could make the perfect location for a company that needs to impress clients with fancy eateries and expensive alfresco cafes quite regularly. This is certainly the case for pharmaceutical firms, advertising companies or even hefty organisations that are constantly searching for new business. There's no need to be concerned about what kind of business you run, the restaurants in the Liverpool region could be a superb added-extra for your firm.When you lease office space in Liverpool in today's market, you can have the office customised and redesigned to meet the particular requirements of your company.</p><p>This is the case, as the landlord will know that companies have different requirements, so in order to acquire a tenant will modify the office to accommodate their individual needs. So if you want to get a new air conditioning unit fixed, a kitchen area built or to get your lighting changed then the owner of a Liverpool office could meet all of your requirements. All of which, will be free so you won't have to worry about the costs.Hopefully you now know what Liverpool can offer your company and also whether it is the right location to help your business to grow.</p>"

It is classed as a 3 star but probably just about deserves a 3.5 thanks to the fact they have just had wireless fitted which comes included in the price.</p><p>If you found this review whilst searching for Manchester airport hotels then its probably a given that you simply need a place to rest and freshen up whilst you wait for your connection and if that is the case,&nbsp;you will find The Bewley well suited.</p><p>You will find reasonably priced food in the dining area as well as bar and an ATM. A nice touch was the receptionist asking what time my flight was in the morning and then receiving an early morning call making sure I was up and reminding me how long before my flight check in was open. Having showered and gone down to check out of The Bewley, I was then offered a complimentary shuttle service to the departures.</p><p>A few of the manchester airport hotels cater for the business traveler and one of these is situated right next door to the Bewley hotel. The Crown Plaza cost me &pound;135 ($270) for the night and is classed a 4 star. For your money you get a buffet style breakfast thrown in but everything else goes on the credit card. Room service was available but prices were on the expensive side. Movies and other entertainment such as Playstation games were available but went straight onto your credit card.</p><p>There was no cash machine on the premises but as everything was charged to your credit card, this was not a problem. Internet access was available through a LAN and as with most Manchester airport hotels a free shuttle service was available although not on the day I stayed. Due to the Glasgow airport attack, no vehicles were allowed to drop off near the terminal entrances which was of course, perfectly understandable.</p><p>For short business trips from the airport such as Manchester Gatwick, Manchester Isle of Man etc. The Crown Plaza offers airport car parking at 15 ($30) a day. This was the cheapest I saw on offer during my time at the airport.</p><p>During the time I stayed at both The Crown Plaza and The Bewley (July 2007) I found the staff to be eager to please and pleasant and I can recommend both these Manchester airport hotels. For the business traveler who is perhaps flying into Manchester and requires somewhere for a meeting or two and has an expense account then the Crown Plaza would be the first choice. If on the other hand, you simply need somewhere to rest up while on a long journey, The Bewley offers good value compared to other Manchester airport hotels. If you need cheaper, you may find you will need to travel into the city.</p>"

So what are the benefits of taking up office space in Bristol?Well after consulting professional brokers from officespacefinders.com,&nbsp;I have made a list of the key reasons that companies provide for moving offices to Bristol:Because Bristol is in a great location with the closest airport being only a quick drive away, it is in an exceptionally convenient position if your staff need to go abroad on planes a lot.</p><p>For instance, you could have a few staffers that have to make frequent trips to meet suppliers or that need to attend national conferences based around your particular industry. If it is the case that this is expected of you regularly, you may feel more at ease knowing that the airport is available if you need it. In addition to that if you have customers heading to your office on a regular basis for sales discussions or human resource updates then it is good to know that they can navigate their way to the office at speed.Bristol has a lot to offer a new business but it also has a lot of offer potential clients as it has an array of facilities certain to impress, which could make them take up your business.</p><p>These might be local restaurants and attractions or even Bristol enterprise centres, which may go some way in exhibiting that your firm is a force to be reckoned with. At the end of the day, you want to give off the right impression to your clients and the first thing that they are going to see and assess is your position in the area and your office space.When you lease office space in Bristol in today's market, you can have the office redesigned and customised to fulfil the needs of your business. This is a viable option because the landlord recognises that many firms have a selection of requirements so to secure a new tenant will alter the office space to fulfil their specific needs. So if you want a modern kitchen fitted, to get your office split into two or get an AC unit installed then the landlord of a Bristol office could handle it all on your behalf.</p><p>Better yet you won't have to put your hand in your pocket because its free.As the Bristol region has been the subject of much new development, it is now in possession of an extensive range of office spaces, which could be perfect as a prospective office for your company. When you start to look around properties with your commercial property agent you will want to view a handful of different offices so that you can pick the right one for your company. So, as Bristol is a hot spot for office space, it means that if you are in the market for an office in Bristol, then a company such as officespacefinders.com will have a number of great offices on its books for you to see.Having premises in a well known area is necessary for a selection of businesses and one particular reason is that it is very beneficial to be situated near to similar businesses and suppliers.</p><p>This is clever because without a network of links to other businesses a company can feel out of the loop and unequipped to handle client needs. If your enterprise needs traditional office supplies or heavy duty tools, then being in the right location could be very convenient. That is why a lot of companies have ended up taking offices in the bustling centre of Bristol as opposed to some isolated area on the boundaries of the region, it proves fruitful in the long run.If your office is a bit outdated and doesn't include many modern fittings then it might not be suitable for you anymore. For example, it could have few power outlets and not enough wiring, which means that you might not be able to function as a company. Additionally, an old and rundown office may not wow business clients - it could give them the wrong impression about your company. You may be intent on improving your company persona, in which case there is a vast selection of modern offices in Bristol that can meet your needs with flair.</p><p>As many Bristol residents will attest, the locality has a good number of public transport links, which is the best thing for commuting staff. This network may not be the best on the planet but it is very convenient if you want to secure an office in the Bristol locale and are concerned about your workers getting to work on time. Plus, the public transport in Bristol is also good for clients who need to get to your offices for meetings. But do remember not to try to secure an office in an area that is hard for clients and staff to reach.Hopefully now you have a clear idea of why companies are making the move to Bristol and whether or not moving to Bristol would be beneficial for your business.</p>"
