        "text": "<p>Thanks for looking! I'm <strong>Mohak</strong>, and this is my unique travel website. I'm an Indian world traveler from a city in Punjab. I first fell in love with travel and the outdoors during a 2015 hiking trip to the rocky mountains in Himachal Pradesh. The next year, I did my first major international trip -- a solo road trip across Iceland. My budget was small, so I slept in the back of a rental car for 1 month while I drove 7,000 kilometers around the country, filming all of the scenic places in Iceland. One of my first videos racked up a few million views and was featured on international TV by BBC Travel. Since then I've solo traveled to many developing countries, including almost every country in Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>I experienced the&nbsp;7.0 Lombok earthquake in Indonesia in 2018, the&nbsp;bombings in Bangkok in 2019, and a fair share of scams, fights, sicknesses, auto accidents, and other crazy things along the way.</p><p>It hasn't always been easy, but over the years I've been blessed with some amazing experiences like&nbsp;sleeping in jungle treehouses&nbsp;in&nbsp;Bali,&nbsp;trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp&nbsp;in the Himalayas, going on&nbsp;Komodo dragon safaris&nbsp;in Indonesia,&nbsp;dining on tarantulas and scorpions&nbsp;in Cambodia,&nbsp;riding a camel to the Great Pyramids of Giza&nbsp;in Egypt, skydiving in&nbsp;Oahu Hawaii,&nbsp;touring medieval Samurai castles&nbsp;in Japan, and visiting some timeless world monuments like the&nbsp;Taj Mahal,&nbsp;Tikal,&nbsp;Machu Picchu,&nbsp;Hagia Sophia,&nbsp;Angkor Wat, and&nbsp;Petra. In 2018, I traveled to 24 countries in one year, which is a personal record so far! I do this on a pretty modest budget and rarely spend more than $30/day on my travels, including accommodation and food.</p><p>I haven't been everywhere, but&nbsp;it's on my list! I'm always looking for new adventures. I hope my&nbsp;travel blog&nbsp;can help and inspire you in your own journeys as well!</p>"
